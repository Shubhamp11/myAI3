At the top, place a slim header bar with a small monochrome geometric icon on the left (abstract factory/robot), the centered title “Talk with CompliBot”, and a small “+ New” button on the right. Beneath the header, create a vertically centered single-column card with generous margins. Inside this card, place a simple avatar/brand mark at the top, followed by a large bold greeting “Hello! My name is CompliBot”. Keep the styling restrained — no owner names, no dates, no decorative graphics. Directly beneath the greeting, add exactly three pill-shaped quick prompts arranged horizontally with even spacing: “Do I need a factory license?”, “What are my labour rights?”, and “Tell me about waste management.” These pills should have soft outlines, gentle hover lift, and tidy keyboard focus rings.

Below the quick prompts, design a scrollable chat region where messages appear as clean conversation bubbles. Assistant messages should use a very light card tint and be left-aligned (full-width on mobile), with rounded corners and readable spacing. User messages should be right-aligned, more compact, and softly tinted. Avoid dense text; encourage comfortable line-height and short paragraphs. When the assistant is generating a reply, show a subtle typing indicator — three softly pulsing dots and a faint skeleton placeholder, never a harsh spinner. If the assistant reply contains sources, display a small muted line underneath such as “Sources · Last checked: [date]”. At the bottom, include a sticky, rounded input area with a multi-line text box on the left and a circular send button on the right. Placeholder text should read: “Ask CompliBot about compliance, registrations, fines — e.g., ‘Do I need a factory licence?’” Enter sends, Shift+Enter creates a new line, and when loading, the input dims and the send button shows a small spinner.

Throughout the UI, use subtle purpose-driven motion: buttons scale up slightly on hover (1.02x), new messages fade in with a gentle upward slide, and any expandable source sections open with a smooth height animation. The overall interface should feel confident, trustworthy, and uncluttered — a high-end professional assistant for business owners, not playful or decorative.
